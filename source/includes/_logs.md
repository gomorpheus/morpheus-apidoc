# Logs

The Logs API allows fetching log records generated by your containers, hosts, and clusters.

## Get All Logs

Fetch a paginated list of logs records. By default the most recent records are returned.  Results may be scoped to specific containers, servers or a cluster.

```shell
curl "$MORPHEUS_API_URL/api/logs"
  -H "Authorization: BEARER $MORPHEUS_API_TOKEN"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
